# Wearable Robotic Third Arm

## Goal:

We propose to develop an online controller for the third arm, which will continuously adapt the robotâ€™s motion based on the 
observed human motion. The key challenge is to avoid collisions with the human body and any other obstacles in the workspace. Also, since the third arm is underactuated (5 DoF) this adds to the difficulty in computing online joint-space trajectories towards the target location. Finally, the controller needs to compensate for the motion of the base arm.

## Running the Code on third-arm-computer
`cd third_arm_noetic_ws/`  
`source devel/setup.bash`  
`roslaunch third_arm third_arm_noetic.launch`  

## What to Run when Building
`catkin build -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3`  

## Running MotiveTracker
Switch to HRC2 network  
`source devel/setup.bash`  
`roslaunch mocap_optitrack mocap.launch`  
`rostopic echo /tf`  

## Debugging Connections

Port not found:
- Make sure using a port on the back of the PC, 1 from the left looking from behind. There is a USB extension connected to it for convenience.  

Error finding Dynamixel Motor:
- Shut down all terminals  
- Unplug WRTA from computer and power  
- Plug in power  
- Plug in USB cable  
- Rerun scripts
