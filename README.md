# Wearable Robotic Third Arm

## Goal:

We propose to develop an online controller for the third arm, which will continuously adapt the robotâ€™s motion based on the 
observed human motion. The key challenge is to avoid collisions with the human body and any other obstacles in the workspace. Also, since the third arm is underactuated (5 DoF) this adds to the difficulty in computing online joint-space trajectories towards the target location. Finally, the controller needs to compensate for the motion of the base arm.

## Setting up the code  
Install PyPot using command line (Python 3): python -m pip install PyPot    
Install PyPot (Python 2.7): pip install PyPot==3.3.1  
Set ACM0 permissions, type in command line for usb port using: sudo chmod 0777 /dev/ttyUSB0  

## Running the Code on third-arm-computer
Plug in Power  
Plug in USB  
`export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.0.124:11311`  
`export ROS_IP=192.168.0.124`  
`cd third_arm_noetic_ws/`  
`source devel/setup.bash`  
`roslaunch third_arm third_arm_noetic.launch`  

## What to Run when Building
`catkin build -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3`  

## Running MotiveTracker
Switch to HRC2 network  
`source devel/setup.bash`  
`roslaunch mocap_optitrack mocap.launch`  
`rostopic echo /tf`  

## Debugging Connections

Port not found:
- Make sure using a port on the back of the PC, 1 from the left looking from behind. There is a USB extension connected to it for convenience.  

Error finding Dynamixel Motor:
- Shut down all terminals  
- Unplug WRTA from computer and power  
- Plug in power  
- Plug in USB cable  
- Rerun scripts
